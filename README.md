# Neural network

`Simple Neural Network Implementation in C# without Third-Party Libraries`

This project is a result of personal exploration and a commitment to understanding the inner workings of neural networks. 
While the code is a work in progress, it is functional and provides a solid foundation for learning and experimentation.

This neural network is developed entirely from scratch, without relying on any third-party libraries or modules. 
By building every component from the ground up, it provides a deep understanding of how neural networks work at a fundamental level.

The neural network employs a layered architecture, consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains neurons that process and propagate information through the network.

- Forward Propagation: 

> Understand the process of forward propagation, where input data is fed into the network, passed through each layer, and produces an output. Observe how the weights and biases of neurons contribute to the output calculations.

- Backpropagation: 

> Learn about backpropagation, an essential algorithm for training neural networks. Discover how errors are propagated backward through the network, and how gradient descent is utilized to adjust the weights and biases to minimize these errors.
